Developed the popular Flappy Bird game using basic C++ programming, focusing on fundamental game development concepts. The project involved creating the game loop, handling player input, and managing the physics of the game, including gravity, collision detection, and score tracking.

Key features include:

Core Mechanics: Implemented the primary game mechanics such as the bird's flapping motion, gravity simulation, and collision detection with obstacles.
Game Loop: Designed an efficient game loop to handle rendering, user input, and game state updates.
Score Tracking: Integrated a scoring system that tracks the player's progress, encouraging continuous play.
Basic Graphics and Animation: Utilized simple ASCII graphics to render the game environment and animate the bird and obstacles.
This project demonstrates a strong understanding of game development principles using C++ and serves as a foundation for more advanced game development endeavors.
